#Set data type
#Set datatype are unordered collection of data thats store uniqe value..

# l = {1,2,4,5,6,1}  #If you write a value two times it changes into 1 thats why its unique
# print(l)
# l.add(7)  #By usnig add function you can add some value in the set
# l.remove(7)  #By using remove method you can remove the value in the set but if you try to some
#value in the set which did't exist so its show an error.To solve this we use..
#l.discard(7) #Thsi method did't show the error when you want to remove some value which did't exsist..
# l2 = l.copy()#By coping method you make the same copy of the set
#If you want to clear all the value in the set so we use clear function...
# l.clear()
# print(l)


#More things in set
#You can you use for loop or if statment like we use in list...So its common but
#In math we learn two set
#Union Set
#Intersection Set

# u1 = {1,2,3,4}
# u2 = {3,4,5,6}

# union = u1 | u2 #In union method it store the value in order by combining the two or three set
# print(union)

# intersection = u1 & u2#In intersection it make a new set by chosing common items in the set
# print(intersection)
