#lambda function
#lambda are built in fuction which is use to write a function in one line

# multi = lambda a,b : a*b
# print(multi(4,3))
#in lambda function first we write lambda than we write the parameters and than semi colan
#and than write the method which we want to return..
#First it is only in python but now its in in c++ or java


#lambda exersice 
#lets define a function to print the output if the argument passed by the users module by 2 and the asnwer is True

# def in_even(a):
#     return a%2 == 0

# print(in_even(4))

#In lambda
# even_odd = lambda a : a%2 == 0
# print(even_odd(3))

#last char

# last_char = lambda a : a[-1]
# print(last_char('Aliyan'))


#Conditions in lambda 
#In conditions statment first we write the return value and than we write the conditions and than else
# leng = lambda a : True if len(a) > 5 else False

# print(leng('asg'))
